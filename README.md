# Smart Irrigation System

## Overview
The Smart Irrigation System is designed to automate the watering process for plants based on environmental conditions. The system utilizes various sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and ambient light to determine when to activate a water pump.

## Components
The following components were used in this project:
- **Arduino Uno R3**
- **PCF8574-based, 32 (0x20) LCD 16 x 2 (I2C)**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **DC Motor**
- **H-bridge Motor Driver**
- **Temperature Sensor (TMP36)**
- **Ambient Light Sensor (Phototransistor)**
